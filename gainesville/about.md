# About

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the center of modern research. Throughout 2018, events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

<b>ResBaz Gainesville will be hosted by the University of Florida on August 15 - 17, 2018</b>, with organizational and funding support from the [UF Carpentry Club](https://uf-carpentry.org).

In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!

We are kicking things off with concurrent 2-day workshops in Python and R (on August 15-16) followed by a day of FREE talks, lunch, career panel, and tutorials and demos. This is a chance for students and researchers across UF to come together to learn, share knowledge and skills, and meet others.
